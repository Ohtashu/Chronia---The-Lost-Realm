🌟 Chronia: The Lost Realm
📖 Overview

Chronia: The Lost Realm is an experimental 2D action RPG built in Unity, inspired by the fast-paced combat and charming pixel-art style of Secret of Grindea.

⚠️ Note: This project is currently in early development (WIP). Core systems such as combat, exploration, and interaction are still being built, and nothing is fully functional yet.
🎮 Game Concept

    Genre: Action RPG (Pixel-Art, 2D)

    Core Gameplay Goals:

        🗺️ Explore handcrafted maps (forest, dungeon, town)

        ⚔️ Engage in real-time combat (attack, dodge, interact)

        🎒 Collect items and interact with environmental props

        👾 Encounter enemies and uncover fragments of story

    Planned Features:

        ⚡ Responsive real-time combat system

        🧩 Prefab-driven world objects (trees, rocks, dungeon rooms)

        🎨 Pixel-art visuals using 16×16 tiles

        🔊 Music and sound effects for immersion

        💻 Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, Android)

📚 Story (Beta Demo Concept)

In the ancient realm of Chronia, balance was maintained by mysterious relics hidden across the land. These relics preserved harmony between nature and magic—until one by one they began to fade. Now, corruption spreads, twisting once-peaceful creatures into dangerous foes.

You play as a young adventurer who discovers the first signs of corruption within the Forest of Whispers.

The beta demo will eventually feature:

    🌲 A small forest area for exploration

    👾 Early encounters with corrupted creatures

    📖 Lore fragments about Chronia’s lost relics

    🏰 First steps into a dungeon beneath the forest

⚙️ Tech & Tools

    Engine: Unity (2D URP)

    Language: C#

    Workflow: Tilemap + Prefabs for modular world design

    Assets: Pixel-art sprites (16×16 tiles), sliced and organized

    Target Platforms: Windows, Linux, Android
