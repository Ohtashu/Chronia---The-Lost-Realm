# Chronia: The Lost Realm

## 📖 Overview
Chronia: The Lost Realm is a **2D action RPG** built in Unity, inspired by the fast-paced combat and charming pixel-art style of *Secret of Grindea*.
This project is developed as a **small-scale demo (beta)** for a school project, focusing on the fundamentals of **exploration, combat, and interactive environments**.

⚠️ **Note:** This project is currently in **early development (WIP)**. Core systems such as combat, exploration, and interaction are still being built, and nothing is fully functional yet.

## 🎮 Game Concept
- **Genre:** Action RPG (Pixel-Art, 2D)
- **Core Gameplay Loop:**

  - Engage in real-time combat (attack, dodge, interact).
  - Collect items and interact with environmental props.
  - Encounter enemies and uncover fragments of story.

- **Key Features (Planned):**
  - ⚔️ Real-time combat system
  - 🗺️ Tilemap-based world design
  - 🧩 Prefab-driven world objects (trees, rocks, dungeon rooms)
  - 🎨 Pixel-art 16×16 style
  - 🔊 Basic music and sound effects
  - 💻 Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, Android)

## 📚 Story (Beta Demo)
In the ancient realm of **Chronia**, balance was maintained by mysterious relics hidden across the land. These relics kept the natural order intact, but one by one they began to fade, and corruption seeped into the world.

You play as a young adventurer who discovers the first signs of this corruption within the **Forest of Whispers**. Strange creatures now wander the land, and the once-peaceful forest hides a secret dungeon waiting to be uncovered.

The beta demo features:
- A small forest area for exploration.
- Early encounters with corrupted creatures.
- A glimpse into the lore of Chronia’s lost relics.
- A first step into the dungeon beneath the forest.
